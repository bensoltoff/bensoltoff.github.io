As a teacher, I believe my primary mission is to prepare students to be educated and enlightened citizens who lead productive and meaningful lives. Our society depends on educated individuals capable of participating in all aspects of our society, including the political process. Answers to normative questions about politics must rely in part on our observed understanding of how society and political actors actually behave, and all of my course objectives support this approach by developing both higher and lower order thinking skills. I recognize that teaching is a skill which is best honed by training, research, and application, and continually seek to improve my skills as an educator.
